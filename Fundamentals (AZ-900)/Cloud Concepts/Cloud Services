High Availability:
High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur. 
Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service. These guarantees are part of the service-level agreements (SLAs).


Scalability:
Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand. 
If you suddenly experience peak traffic and your systems are overwhelmed, the ability to scale means you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand.
Scaling generally comes in two varieties: vertical and horizontal. 
Vertical scaling is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources. Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources.

Vertical scaling:
With vertical scaling, if you were developing an app and you needed more processing power, you could vertically scale up to add more CPUs or RAM to the virtual machine.

Horizontal scaling:
With horizontal scaling, if you suddenly experienced a steep jump in demand, your deployed resources could be scaled out (either automatically or manually). 
For example, you could add additional virtual machines or containers, scaling out.


Service Level Agreement:
A Service level agreement (SLA)  is the formal agreement between a service provider and customer that guarantees the customer a stated level of service. 
SLAs are also used inside organizations, in a agreement between the IT department and the business users. 
SLA commonly includes details like what is defined as downtime, when the service is unavailable , and any credit you may be entitled to, if the SLA is not met. 


Reliability:
Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. 
The cloud, by virtue of its decentralized design, naturally supports a reliable and resilient infrastructure. 
With a decentralized design, the cloud enables you to have resources deployed in regions around the world.
